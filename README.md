# **Classification-CardioVascular-Risk-Pridiction**
This project will be performed with the help of Supervised Classification model to predict the risk of getting Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) in 10 years from the dataset of CHD. We will be performing basic checks on the data for any errors followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) , then some feature engineering, class imbalane handling and at last we will train our Machine Learning model on the data to predict the risk of getting CHD in 10 years followed by evaluation of the model.

## Problem Statement
* The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.
* The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 3390 records and 17 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factor
* The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

## Data provided
We have a dataset of CHD including Id, education, sex, is_smoking, BPMeds, prevalentStroke, prevalentHyp, diabetes, age, cigsPerDay, totChol, sysBP, diaBP, BMI, heartRate, glucose and TenYearCHD(our dependent variable). All personal details have been removed. Data set has 17 columns and 3390 rows.
